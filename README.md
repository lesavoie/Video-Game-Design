# Video Games in Python

This repository includes a few basic video games written in Python.

To run these games:

1. Download Thonny from https://thonny.org/ and install it. These instructions were written based on Thonny 3.3.13.
2. Download this code by clicking on the green `Code` button above, clicking `Download ZIP`, and unzipping it somewhere on your computer. It will create a folder called `Video-Game-Design-main`.
3. Open Thonny, click the `Tools` menu at the top, then click `Manage packages...`. Under `Install from requirements file`, click the `here` link, find the `Video-Game-Design-main` folder, click on the `requirements.txt` file, and click `Open`. It will take a few minutes to install the required libraries.
4. Open the required file for the game you want to run. If you double click on the file it should open in Thonny automatically.
    1. For Asteroids, open `Game.py`
	2. For Pong, open `Pong.py`
	3. For Skeet, open `Skeet.py`
5. In Thonny, click the `Run Current Script` button (it's a green circle with a white arrow near the top).

You can also make changes to the games. In each file, you can change the variables near the top to modify different aspects of the game. In Asteroids, you should change the variables in Global.py, and you can also change the images used for the various objects.

Have fun!!!
